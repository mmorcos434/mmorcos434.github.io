## 👩 About Me
Hi! My name is **Marina Morcos**, a Computer Science student minoring in Mathematics at the City College of New York. My passion for technology comes from my love of creative problem solving and collaboration.

Through my experience as a CUNY Tech Prep fellow, CLEAR Workforce apprentice, research AI robotics intern at Hunter College and my participation in the Accenture Career Catalyst Program, I’ve only deepened my interest in using technology to make an impact. I've used my hands-on experience in Python, C++, and Java to strengthen my technical skills and bring ideas to life.

I’m open to exploring a range of opportunities in tech and am always looking to learn, grow, and collaborate on innovative ideas. Some of my key interests include product management, AI, Data Science, and Consulting. 

✨ Fun fact: I have two cats, play the ukulele, and I also have a license to fix planes!
